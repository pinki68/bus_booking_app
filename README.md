Online Bus Ticket Booking Application 

1. Setting Up Backend (Spring Boot)

  A. Initialize Spring Boot Project

Use Spring Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project.

Include dependencies:

Spring Web

Spring Data JPA

MySQL Driver

Spring Security

Validation

JWT (via custom config or third-party library)


B. Define Entities

Bus: Represents bus information such as source, destination, date, time, and available seats.

Booking: Captures booking details, user association, seat count, etc.

Passenger/User: Stores user information like name, email, password, and roles.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Implement RESTful APIs

Use @RestController to expose endpoints for:

User Registration and Authentication

Fetching bus routes

Booking tickets

Viewing booking history

-----------------------------------------------------------------
D. Database Configuration
Use MySQL as the backend database.

Configure in application.properties:
Ensure all entities are annotated with JPA annotations.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. Setting Up Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript or Thymeleaf)

A. UI Design

Use HTML and Thymeleaf templates or JavaScript-based views.

Pages include:

Home Page

Bus Search Page

Booking Page

Login/Registration

Profile Page

Booking History

B. Styling

Use Bootstrap for responsive and styled components.

Ensure mobile-friendly layout and user-friendly forms.

------------------------------------------------

3. User Registration and Authentication

1. User Registration

HTML form to collect name, email, and password.

Client-side validation using JavaScript.

Server-side validation using annotations like @NotBlank, @Email, etc.

Spring Boot API to save user data securely.

2. User Authentication

Login form to collect credentials.

Use Spring Security and JWT for authentication.

Generate and send JWT token upon successful login.

Store JWT in localStorage/sessionStorage on the frontend

--------------------------------------------------------

4. Bus Ticket Booking

1. Browse and Select Bus Routes

Input fields: From, To, Date.

Use JavaScript to fetch available routes via REST API.

Display results in a table or card layout.

2. Booking Process

Allow user to select a route and enter passenger details.

Send booking details to backend via POST request.

Show confirmation and e-ticket on success.

---------------------------------------------
5. User Profile and Booking History

1. User Profile

Show user data with an option to edit.

Allow password change (with proper validation).

Placeholder for managing payment methods (optional).

2. Booking History

Fetch bookings using a REST API.

Display in tabular format with fields like date, route, seat count, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------

6. Testing

A. Unit Testing

Use JUnit and Mockito for testing services, controllers, and repositories.

Write test cases for:

User Registration/Login

Fetching routes

Booking flow

Data validation

B. Integration Testing

Use Spring Boot test tools for end-to-end testing.

Ensure security context is applied during tests.

------------------------------------------------
Notes

Ensure password encryption using BCrypt.

Secure APIs using Spring Security filters.

Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

Use proper error handling and return meaningful error messages.
